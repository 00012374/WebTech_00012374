# WebTech_00012374
CW for the Web Technology module 

This particular app is created for the tickets generation. User can choose the case for repoting the problem, and right after this random code will be generated for the purpose that user can check the status of his report. The similar Web app we created during the WevTech classes, that is why I decided to make application like this.

How to run the application?

1. First of all open command line, tab Win+R and type cmd;
2. Second step install requried packages. They are "npm install express pug" and "npm install --save-dev".
3. And then open the file named 00012374 via VS code app. 
4. Open new Terminal and type "node app".
5. Booom, great so far. Now you can open the application via any browser, just search for localhost:3000.

I have deployed my application to the glitch. Link for the hosted app : https://jet-delightful-spoonbill.glitch.me/
